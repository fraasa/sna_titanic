    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The primary objective this week was to construct a visual representation of a graph, representing the relationships and interactions among the characters in the Titanic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Construction\n",
    "In our graphical illustration:\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent individual *characters* in the movie\n",
    "- **Edges** indicate the presence of a *shared scene* between two characters\n",
    "- **Edge weights** reflect the *frequency* of these shared scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Analysis\n",
    "We then analyzed the graph by determining some of its basic properties:\n",
    "- **Total number of nodes and edges**: to understand the *scale and complexity* of the graph\n",
    "- **Average degree**: computed using the formula \\\\(\\\\frac{2E}{N}\\\\), where \\\\(E\\\\) stands for the total number of edges and \\\\(N\\\\) is the number of nodes, giving an average of *connections per node*\n",
    "- **Graph density**: calculated with \\\\(D = \\\\frac{2E}{N \\\\times (N-1)}\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is the density, \\\\(E\\\\) is the number of edges and \\\\(N\\\\) is the number of nodes. This metric is useful to understand how many connections are present in the graph, compared to the maximum possible number of connections, hence providing an insight into the *overall connectivity*. The density of a graph can range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating a graph with no edges and 1 a graph with the maximum number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights gained\\n\",\n",
    "By computing these metrics, we were able to gain a better understanding of the graph's structure and complexity. In particular, we obtained a foundational knowledge that will be expanded upon in the following weeks."
