Doc Week 1
As part of this week's tasks, our initial step involved creating a visual representation of a graph. In this graph, each character in our dataset was denoted as a distinct node, and the thickness of the edges connecting them was indicative of the frequency of scenes in which these characters shared screen time.

To further analyze the graph, we needed to determine some fundamental graph properties. Firstly, we set out to calculate the total number of nodes and edges within the graph.

One of the metrics we computed was the average degree which is computed using the formula 2E/N, where 'E' represents the total number of edges and 'N' is the number of nodes in the graph. Additionally, we looked into the graph density, which provides insights into the overall connectivity of the graph. The formula for graph density is D = 2E / (N * (N-1)), where 'D' represents the graph density, 'E' is the total number of edges, and 'N' is the number of nodes.

By calculating these metrics, we gained a deeper understanding of the relationships and interactions among the characters in our dataset.t
