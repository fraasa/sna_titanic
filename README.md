# Social Network Analysis (SNA) Project: Exploring the Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository of our Social Network Analysis (SNA) project, where we delve into exploring the intricate web of relationships and interactions among characters from the Titanic dataset. Throughout the course weeks, we aim to not only visually represent these connections but also analyze them through various graph metrics.

*Title: Unveiling Titanic's Social Fabric: A Network Analysis*

*Introduction:*

Meet the minds behind the exploration of Titanic's intricate social network â€” Alexandra Tabarani, Marta Torella, Francesca Romana Sanna, Sofia Bruni and Leonardo Azzi. As a collaborative force, we embark on a captivating journey into the dynamic relationships woven throughout the iconic Titanic movie.

In our Social Network Analysis (SNA) project, the characters aboard the Titanic take center stage as nodes, while the edges connecting them represent shared scenes, their weights reflecting the frequency of these shared appearances. This analytical approach allows us to decode the complex web of interactions that shaped the destinies of the movie characters.

Through meticulous examination, we aim to uncover not only the characters but also the subtle patterns of connection that underscore the narrative. Moreover, our goal is to enrich our network with previously undiscovered information.

Join us as we navigate the network to understand the Titanic's social dynamics!

## Week 1: Introduction to Graph Creation and Basic Analysis

### Objective
The primary objective this week was to construct a visual representation of a graph, representing the relationships and interactions among the characters in the Titanic dataset.

### Graph Construction
In our graphical representation:
- **Nodes**: Represent individual characters from the dataset.
- **Edges**: Indicate relationships between characters, where the thickness of an edge signifies the frequency of scenes shared by the connected characters.

### Graph Analysis
We further analyzed the graph by determining some fundamental properties:
- **Total Number of Nodes and Edges**: To understand the scale and complexity of the graph.
- **Average Degree**: Computed using the formula \(\frac{2E}{N}\), where \(E\) represents the total number of edges and \(N\) is the number of nodes in the graph. This metric gives an average indication of the number of connections per node.
- **Graph Density**: Calculated using the formula \(D = \frac{2E}{N \times (N-1)}\), where \(D\) represents the graph density, \(E\) is the total number of edges, and \(N\) is the number of nodes. This metric provides insights into the overall connectivity of the graph.

### Insights Gained
By calculating these metrics, we were able to deepen our understanding of the relationships and interactions among the characters in our dataset, providing a foundational knowledge that will be expanded upon in the subsequent weeks.

## Week 2: Average Clustering and Transitivity number

### Objective
This week objective was to exploit some centrality measures (Average Clustering and Transitivity) in order to better analyze the network's structural characteristics by identifying the key nodes. 

### Average Clustering and Transitivity number with Networkx
As a first step we implemented the Average Clustering and the Transitivity by using the respective built-in functions in Networkx; both metrics were used to understand the interconnectedness among nodes in our network.
-**Average Clustering**: the average of the clustering coefficients. Each clustering coefficient is computed as the ratio of the number of triangles in which the node we are considering (let's say node i) participates, over the number of wedges of that same node (computed as [ki(ki-1/2)], where ki is the degree of node i ). 
-**Transitivity**: defined as the ratio between the total number of triangles in the network, over the number of wedges divided by three. The mathematical formula related to transitivity could also be expressed as the number of triangles multiplied by three over the sum of all clustering coefficients.

### Compute_Transitivity Implementation
In the second part of this week task, we had to implement from scratch our transitivity function. Our function starts by manually counting the number of triangles in the network by iterating over each node in the graph; by doing so, it finds the neighbours of each node and registers the common ones between one node and its neighbors (which indicates the number of triangles involving the current node). Then the 'triangles' variable, in which the number of triangles in the graph were stored, is divided by 6, since each triangle was originally counted six times( two times for each node of the traingles). Once we obtained the total number of triangles, we start looking for the wedges (or connected triplets) by iterating again through each node in the graph in order to identify again its neighbours and degree so that we could apply the mathematical formula for the number of wedges [ki(ki-1/2)]. The final step of our code computes the Transitivity number as the
