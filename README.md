## Introduction - _Unveiling Titanic's Social Fabric: A Network Analysis_

### Group F members

The minds behind this journey are: **Leonardo Azzi**, **Sofia Bruni**, **Francesca Romana Sanna**, **Alexandra Tabarani** and **Marta Torella**, five students of the Bachelor in Management and Computer Science.

Throughout the course weeks, we aim to not only visually represent these connections but also analyze them through various graph metrics.

In our project, the **characters** aboard the Titanic take center stage as _nodes_, while the _edges_ connecting them represent **shared scenes**, their _weights_ reflecting the **frequency** of these shared appearences.
This analytical approach allows us to decode the complex web of interactions that shaped the destinies of the movie characters.

Through meticulous examination, we will be able to uncover the characters as well as the patterns of connection that lie underneath the narrative.
