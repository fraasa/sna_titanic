## week 10 
### Objective:
This week objective was to investigate an hypothetical spread of information in our graph in order to understand the influence that each node was able to carry out on its neighbours. We decided to implement the Bass Contagion Model sice we were interested in exploring the beheviour of the agents in our graph such that the 'innovation' (since we are analysing a movie we thought of the innovation as a sort of "change in the characters' behaviour") could have been adopted due to neighbours influence on the node/movie character but also due to 'self innovation', meaning that a character can 'adopt the innovation', so change their mind, even on their own and withouth being influenced by anyone. 
### Bass Contagion Model
The first step we took in building our Bass Contagion Model was to initialize the adoption state of each node in the graph: nodes listed in initial_adopted_nodes start with the trait adopted (True), and others start with the trait not adopted (False). Then our bass_contagion_model function starts by iterating for a specified number of iterations and for each iteration, the function computes the adoption probability for nodes that have not adopted the trait yet based on the adoption probability, or better the probability that a specific node adopts the innovation given by considering two important parameters: s which takes into account the probability of self innovation and q which accounts for the probability at each iteration for a node to get activated due to an active neighbour. Finally the node makes the adoption if its probability of adoption is bigger than a random threshold. As a matter of a fact teh Bass Contagion Model is a Sthocastic Random model, which means that randomness has to be taken into account. In the end the code will register the hypothetical adoption for each node at each iteration, and plot the a graph for every iteration we computed, where the green nodes represnt the characters that adopted the innovation, while the red ones the characters that didn't.
