## week 10 
### Objective:
This week objective was to investigate an hypothetical spread of information in our graph in order to understand the influence that each node was able to carry out on its neighbours. We decided to implement the Bass Contagion Model sice we were interested in exploring the beheviour of the agents in our graph such that the 'innovation' (since we are analysing a movie we thought of the innovation as a sort of 'change in the characters' behaviour') could have been adopted due to neighbours influence on the node/movie character but also due to 'self innovation', meaning that a character can 'adopt the innovation', so change their mind, even on their own and withouth being influenced by anyone.
